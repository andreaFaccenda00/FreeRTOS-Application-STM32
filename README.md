# 🚦 STM32 Traffic Light Controller with Pedestrian Signal (FreeRTOS)

## 📝 Overview

This project implements a **traffic light control system** using an STM32 microcontroller and **FreeRTOS**. It features:

- 🚘 Three traffic lights (Sem1, Sem2, Sem3) controlled via GPIOs  
- 🚶‍♂️ A pedestrian crossing with a final **blinking warning phase**  
- 🔁 RTOS task synchronization using **semaphores**

The traffic lights follow a coordinated sequence ensuring safe vehicle and pedestrian flow.

## 🧱 System Architecture

### 🚦 Traffic Lights

- **Sem1Task** – Controls the first traffic light on GPIOA (PA0, PA1, PA4)
- **Sem3Task** – Controls the third traffic light on GPIOC (PC10, PC11, PC12)
- **Sem2Task** – Controls the central traffic light on GPIOC (PC6, PC8, PC9) and the pedestrian LED on GPIOB (PB5)

### 🔄 Sequence Logic

1. **Sem1 and Sem3** alternate their green/yellow/red cycles independently.
2. Once **both Sem1 and Sem3** have completed their cycles, **Sem2** runs.
3. Sem2 enables pedestrian crossing:
   - ✅ Pedestrian LED is **solid ON** for 4 seconds
   - ⚠️ Then **blinks for 1 second**
4. At the end, control is returned to Sem1 and Sem3, and the cycle repeats.

## ⏱️ Timing Configuration

| Phase                | Duration (ms) |
|----------------------|---------------|
| 🟢 Green Light        | 4000          |
| 🟡 Yellow Light       | 1500          |
| 🚶‍♂️ Pedestrian Solid | 4000          |
| 🚨 Pedestrian Blinking| 1000          |
| 🔁 Blink Interval     | 250           |

## 🔗 FreeRTOS Synchronization

- 🔓 `sem1SemHandle` – Binary semaphore to trigger Sem1  
- 🔓 `sem3SemHandle` – Binary semaphore to trigger Sem3  
- 🔢 `sem2SemHandle` – **Counting semaphore** used to ensure both Sem1 and Sem3 have completed before Sem2 starts  

Each task runs in a loop and waits for its semaphore before proceeding.
